### 1.Introduction of seq2seq models and application

<font >TextSequence to sequence was first introduced by Google in 2014. So let‚Äôs go through our question what is seq2 seq model? Sequence to sequence model tries to map input text with fixed length to output text fixed-length where the length of input and output to the model may differ. As we know variants of Recurrent neural networks like Long short-term memory or Gated Recurrent Neural Network (GRU) are the method we mostly used since they overcome the problem of vanishing gradient.

## 5.So why does the seq2seq model fails?

###  As the Details of the architecture and function already explained by my colleagues so now we see where this model lags. 

#### As we saw encoder takes input and converts it into a fixed-size vector and then the decoder makes a prediction and gives output sequence. It works fine for short sequence but it fails when we have a long sequence because it becomes difficult for the encoder to memorize the entire sequence into a fixed-sized vector and to compress all the contextual information from the sequence. As we observed that as the sequence size increases model performance starts getting degrading.

## 6.Here comes the solution with Attention Mechanism

As the word ‚Äòattention‚Äô suggest importance is given to specific part of context while so as to increase the performance and output interpretation is starts to make sense. In simple terms we give importance to specific parts of the sequence instead of the entire sequence predict that word. Basically, in the attention, we don‚Äôt throw away the intermediate from the encoder state but we utilize this to generate context vector from all states so that the decoder gives output result.
*	The attention mechanism has changed the way we work with deep learning algorithms
*	Fields like Natural Language Processing (NLP) and even Computer Vision have been revolutionized by the attention mechanism

**For Example:** For Deep learning we have to read an article and get the inference out it. Or a whole book. Like the human brain attention is given to specific words which mind interprets and grasps others are just a blurry information.

## <font color = blue>12.Drawbacks

The main disadvantage of the **attention mechanism is that it adds more weight parameters to the model**, which can increase training time especially if the input data for the model are long sequences.

In a sequence-to-sequence model (e.g. RNN-based encoder-decoder), the attention mechanism combines the encoder‚Äôs output at each time step, along with the decoder‚Äôs output at time step t, to create the context vector for time step t. The context vector encapsulates the most relevant information from the encoder, which is why attention is a useful mechanism.

However, in calculating the context vector we use trainable weights for each of the encoder‚Äôs time steps.**This can be a very large number of weight parameters if the input data for the encoder is long, which is the case in tasks like text summarization. And the larger a model gets (in terms of number of parameters), the longer it takes to train.**

#### <font color =Red>So the only one drawback of attention is that it‚Äôs time-consuming. To overcome this problem Google introduced <font color=Green>‚ÄúTransformer Model‚Äù .'

## <font color = blue>13.Summary
<img src="https://github.com/jaikushwaha7/Attention-Mechanism---What-and-Why-/blob/main/img20_1.png" />


There are many variants in the cutting-edge researches, and they basically differ in the choice of soft attention and hard attention.
***As, attention mechanism is very actively researched nowadays and it is expected that there will be more and more domains welcoming the application of attentional models.***
